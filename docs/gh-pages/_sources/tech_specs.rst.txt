Introduction
------------

**ATL-100 Firmware** was developed based on the `ESP-IDF framework <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf>`_, which is 
the official IoT development framework for the ESP32, ESP32-S, ESP32-C and ESP32-H series of SoCs. It provides a self-sufficient SDK 
for any generic application development on these platforms, using programming languages such as C and C++. ESP-IDF currently powers 
millions of devices in the field, and enables building a variety of network-connected products, ranging from simple light bulbs and 
toys to big appliances and industrial devices.

Therefore, **ATL-100 Firmware** uses FreeRTOS as a real-time operating system. Each module is implemented in the format of one or more 
operating system threads.
